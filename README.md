14.5 – RC Circuit Application
Solve the following using a MATLAB script.
The equation for the voltage, V, across the capacitor of an RC circuit is
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑑𝑑 = 𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎
Where RC is the product of the resistance and the capacitance and V a is the applied voltage.
Suppose that RC=0.2, the applied voltage is 10 V, and the initial voltage on the capacitor is 2 V.
• Report the voltage after: 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 seconds (give values to 2 decimal places)
• How long does it take for the voltage to reach 8.0 Volts? (give answer to 2 decimal places)
• Plot the voltage V(t) for the first one second. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 10 V. Include
a grid, title, and axis labels.
14.6 – Temperature Application
Solve the following with a MATLAB script. Include an output statement answering the question in the first bullet point.
The equation for the temperature T of a certain object immersed in a liquid bath of constant temperature, Tb, is
10 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑑𝑑 = 𝑑𝑑𝑏𝑏
The initial temperature of the object is 70 ̊F and the bath temperature is 170 ̊F.
• Report the temperature after 10, 20, and 40 seconds
• How long does it take for the object to reach 160 ̊F? (Give answer to one decimal place.)
• Plot the function for T(t) for the first 40 seconds. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 180 ̊C.
Include a grid, title, and axis labels.
